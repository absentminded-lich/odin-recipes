                            &emsp;My wife has a relationship with cookies that is borderline abusive and I am her enabler. For the longest time I didn’t believe that I could ever produce a cookie worthy of her love and so I never attempted it. But with increased skill and knowledge comes confidence – or is it arrogance – and so I attempted. The first batch was fine. A solid cookie, and I mean that literally. The next several batches were more of the same. It wasn’t until I happened upon the Milk Bar Bake Sale episode of The Chef Show that I realized I’ve been overmixing my dough. The secret (that isn’t actually a secret) is to both cream and emulsify the dough for an absurd length of time. And when it’s finally time to add the flour, go all Salt Bae on it; sprinkle it in and move on. Since then, my wife has hailed me as her cookie champion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;I perhaps shouldn’t explain why my cookie recipe has such an unusual name. I perhaps shouldn’t, but I’m going to. It is a terrible joke that I had directed at my wife once or twice or thrice. Where do cookies wind up after you’ve eaten them? Why, into the conveniently placed cookie pouch between the chin and the neck, of course! Her appreciation of that joke is about what you’d expect. I also have a version that is purposely overchilled and overbaked and perfect for dunking into milk. Or rather, for plunging into milk, which is why I’ve given them the completely original and unique name of “Plungers”.
                        </p>

                            &emsp;It is possible that marketing is not my strongest suit.
