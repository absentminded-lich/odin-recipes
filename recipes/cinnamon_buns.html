                            &emsp;Allow me to preface that I don’t like cinnamon buns. They’re far too sweet for me, so I usually have one or two bites before carrying on with my life. And yet I crave to make cinnamon buns more than just about anything else. I suspect it’s the magic within. Not that I believe in magic, but there are foods that seem almost magical in nature and rolled buns full of cinnamon and sugar and butter are certainly among those. Many of us can probably recall a time when we were awoken by that familiar and alluring scent – maybe you were a child or maybe it was this morning – and you struggled to contain your raw excitement as you followed that aroma from your bedroom and into the kitchen. There was no containing your excitement then; not after you had laid eyes on that crowded casserole dish full of frosting and dreams. I have this memory, from decades past, and while my excitement for cinnamon buns has long since faded I am privileged to relive it through the people around me. I get to watch the faces of my wife and two girls light up with anticipation. I get to listen to their audible satisfaction as they devour one, if not two, rolls. I get to witness the magic.

                            &emsp;Of all my collected recipes, this one is still in its infancy. Bright-eyed and bushy tailed and not yet ready for the world. So allow me to introduce it to the world right now. The first couple of times I made cinnamon buns was from a King Arthur Baking Company recipe (the food company and not the speculative former King of Britain had he had a penchant for bread). My wife was never wow’ed and so I pivoted to <a href=”https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/cinnabon-cinnamon-rolls-but-better” target=”_blank”>Joshua Weissman’s Cinnabon recipe</a>. It has been the foundation of my mad scientist experiments of late to perfect those gorgeous swirls. The differences between his recipe and my own are mild (for now), so I must provide credit where credit is due.
